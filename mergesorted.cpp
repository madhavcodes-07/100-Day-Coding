//Problem: A system receives two separate logs of user arrival times from two different servers. E//ach log is already sorted in ascending order. 
//Your task is to create a single chronological log that preserves the correct order of arrivals.

//Input:
//- First line: integer p (number of entries in server log 1)
//- Second line: p sorted integers representing arrival times from server 1
//- Third line: integer q (number of entries in server log 2)
//- Fourth line: q sorted integers representing arrival times from server 2)

//Output:
//- Print a single line containing all arrival times in chronological order, separated by spaces

//Example:
//Input:
//5
//10 20 30 50 70
//4
//15 25 40 60

//Output:
//10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70

//Explanation: Compare the next unprocessed arrival time from both logs and append the earlier one to the final log until all entries are processed


//solution:
