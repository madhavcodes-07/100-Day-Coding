//Problem: A secret system stores code names in forward order. To display them in mirror format,
// you must transform the given code name so that its characters appear in the opposite order.

//Input:
//- Single line: a lowercase string containing only alphabetic characters (no spaces)

//Output:
//- Print the transformed code name after applying the mirror operation

//Example:
//Input:
//hello

//Output:
//olleh

//Explanation: The first character moves to the last position, the second to the second-last, and so on until the entire string is mirrored


//solution:


#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string s;
    cin >> s;

    reverse(s.begin(), s.end());

    cout << s;

    return 0;
